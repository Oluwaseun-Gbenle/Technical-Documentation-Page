            <h2>Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            "Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open
            and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard.
            Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup</li>
            <li>
              ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
            </li>
            <li>
              create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly
            </li>
            <li>
              Blank
            </li>
            <li>
              Blank
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p> Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number
            of criteria you can use to check your work.

            <h2>Adding a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            It's likely that you've seen an alt attribute on an img tag in other challenges. Alt text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also
            used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <.img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">
          </div>
          <p> People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver
            key information.</p>
    
          <p>Good alt text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section id="Knowing_When_Alt_Text_Should_be_Left_Blank" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h2>Knowing When Alt Text Should be Left Blank
            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute when using img tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases alt text may seem redundant
            or unnecessary.</p>
    
          <p>In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <.img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
          </div>
          <p> Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.</p>
    
          <p>Note: For images with a caption, you may still want to include alt text, since it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.</p>

        <section id="Jumping_Straight_to_the_Content_Using-the_main_Element" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h2> Jumping Straight to the Content Using the main Element</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibility features. These tags include main, header, footer, nav, article, and section, among others.
          </p>
          <p>By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble div. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in your markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning
            to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.</p>
          <p>The main element is used to wrap (you guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of your page. It's not meant to include items that repeat across
            pages, like navigation links or banners.</p>
          <p>The main tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If you've ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive
            devices that functionality.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section id="Making_Screen_Reader_Navigation_Easier_with_the_header" class="main-section">
          <h2>
            <header> Making Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.</p>
    
          <p>Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your HTML document. This is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.
